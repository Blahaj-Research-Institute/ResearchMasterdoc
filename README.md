## Definitions

**Sex**: A collection of dimorphic biological characteristics associated with maleness and femaleness, including chromosomes, reproduction, hormones, anatomy, and brain structures. These characteristics are bimodally distributed along a spectrum. 

**Gender**: The roles and expectations assigned socially to individuals based on their perceived maleness, femaleness, masculinity, femininity, and/or stated identity. 

**Gender Identity**: An individual’s innate sense of being a man, a woman, and/or neither. This can differ from one’s gender assigned at birth, and through the process of social transition (which is often accompanied with medical transition), transgender people can make their gender align with their gender identity. 

**Woman**: An individual who is assigned feminine roles and expectations by society based on their perceived femininity, femaleness, and/or stated identity.
