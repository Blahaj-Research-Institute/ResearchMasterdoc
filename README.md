### Content Warnings

Many studies (even those included), due to age or biases, often times use ablelist and/or transphobic language. Many studies discuss cisgender, neurotypical, and able-bodied individuals as "normal" or "typical" while referring to the contrary as "abnormal", "atypical", "not normal", etc. This can be incredibly dehumanizing and exhausting to read these studies in depth. Please be cautious when doing so, and make sure to keep your mental health as your first priority. Articles that are *especially* aggregious should be labeled with an asterisk. Articles with a bias towards eugenics should be excluded.

## Definitions

**Sex**: A collection of dimorphic biological characteristics associated with maleness and femaleness, including chromosomes, reproduction, hormones, anatomy, and brain structures. These characteristics are bimodally distributed along a spectrum. 

**Gender**: The roles and expectations assigned socially to individuals based on their perceived maleness, femaleness, masculinity, femininity, and/or stated identity. 

**Gender Identity**: An individual’s innate sense of being a man, a woman, and/or neither. This can differ from one’s gender assigned at birth, and through the process of social transition (which is often accompanied with medical transition), transgender people can make their gender align with their gender identity. 

**Woman**: An individual who is assigned feminine roles and expectations by society based on their perceived femininity, femaleness, and/or stated identity. 


## Acronyms

**GAHT** Gender Afirming Hormone Therapy

**HRT** Hormone Replacement Therapy

**SRS** (outdated) Sex Reasignment Surgery

## Biological Sex is Mostly Mutable

Many aspects of **biological sex can be changed** through medical transition, though it is not a requirnment to transgender identities.

For trans women on hormone replacement therapy (consisting of bioidentical estrogen and progesterone), they obtain female hormonal profiles, which alters the sexually dimorphic gene expression of their cells (everyone’s cells have the potential to express both male and female traits which are encoded in their DNA, and these traits are turned on and off by hormones). This causes their genes to express female traits, and they obtain real breasts that are anatomically identical to cis females (and capable of lactation (and there are even cis men who lactate, and the composition of their milk is in the normal range)), female skin texture, female body odor, female body fat distribution, female hair patterns in both body hair and head hair, female muscle mass, female bone density, and even female bone structure if they start early enough.

Bottom surgery reconstructs existing genitals into fully functional genitals of the opposite sex (functional genitals, not reproductive organs… although this is actively being researched!).

Medical transition can make trans people infertile, fertility banking should be encouraged for individuals seeking hormone therapy.

Hence, trans people can change their hormonal sex, the sex expression of their genes, their anatomical sex, and they can at least move over to the infertile category of reproductive sex. 


## Brain Sex

The human brain is an incredibly complex organ, with countless different structures specializing in different functions, but also adaptable (neuroplasticity).

### Brain Sex as a Mosaic

For decades we considered the brain to either be male or female (as strictly sexually dimorphic), however, recent research has revealed different frameworks for interpreting the sex of a brain. This has complex and nuanced implications for transgender individuals.

Daphne Joel and Cordelia Fine, experts on the subjects of neuroscience and philosophy of science respectively, argue that 17th and 18th century European society constructed the notoin that gender (& sex) are "meaningfully carved into two categories or “natural kinds,” that are distinct, timeless, and deeply biologically grounded," a conception that has persisted into recent history. This has also been perpetuated by the ableist research into autism and other neurodivergent conditions describing autism as an "extreme male brain" [(Joel & Cordelia, 2018)](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/03/opinion/male-female-brains-mosaic.html)

[2015 research fom Joel et al.](https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.1509654112) represents a picture of human brains as a "mosaics" constituting of more commonly male and more commonly female aspects. Brain sex cnannot be binarized, or even visualized as a continum, but as this mosaic.

### The Transgender Brain

Even with such a small window of sexually dimorphic brain variance, studies indicate that trans people’s brain structures are more in-line with the sex/gender they transition to, *even prior to medical transition*. ([Zubiaurre-Elorza et al. 2013](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22941717/)) ([Luders et al. 2012](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23724358/)) ([Simon et al. 2013](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24391851/)) ([Rametti et al. 2011](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20562024/)) ([Kranz et al. 2014](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25392513/)) ([Hahn et al. 2015](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25217469/)). In tasks where one sex does better on average, transgender people also show to preform closer to their gender identity *even before transition* such as verbal fluency ([Soleman et al. 2013](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23433223/)) ([Cohen-Kettanis et al. 1998](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9802133/))*.

When looking holistically at the research, approximately 25% of research on transgender brains finds no corrolation between trans identities and brain sex, leading to the interpretation that brain sex functions on either a contium or a mosaic rather than a binary. ([Ngyuen et al. 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6235900/)) Research accounting for pre-transition brain sex as a continoum has shown MRI scans of transgender individuals align more with their gender identity than birth sex ([Kurth et al. 2022](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8955456/)) ([Manzouri et al. 2017](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26637450/)) ([Moody et al. 2021](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7750413/)), including a study with almost 400 pre-transition transgender participants ([Muller et al. 2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34030966/))

This research better helps us understand the neurological aspects of trans identities, and can help us better understand how to care for transgender individuals. Research based on our updated understanding of brain sex has helped us understand the unique and fascinating ways in which transgender people develop. ([Wang et al. 2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34030966/))

The other side of the coin, however, is using this research for a biologically deterministic outlook on trans identities as pretext for eugenicist or discriminatory research such as is the case for Autism Speaks (TBD). This research has already been used to attempt to justify Ray Blanchards bunk studies ([Guillamon et al. 2016](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-016-0768-5)).

Ultimately, brain structure is influenced by a complex combination of biological and sociological factors. The precise extent to which sexually dimorphic brain structures result from biological vs sociological factors is unknown, but this doesn’t change the fact that trans people’s brains are more like the sex and gender that they transition to.

### But What About the Chromosomes?

X and Y chromosomal combinations are neither binary, nor a defining characteristic of one’s biological sex characteristics:

XX Males exist - De La Chapelle Syndrome
XY Females exist - Swyer Syndrome, Complete Androgen Insensitivity
X0, XXX, XXY, XYY, XXYY all exist as well!

0.5% of individuals have abnormal sex chromosomes, which accounts for millions of Americans alone and is about as common as being trans!
