### Content Warnings

Many studies (even those included), due to age or biases, often times use ablelist and/or transphobic language.

## Definitions

**Sex**: A collection of dimorphic biological characteristics associated with maleness and femaleness, including chromosomes, reproduction, hormones, anatomy, and brain structures. These characteristics are bimodally distributed along a spectrum. 

**Gender**: The roles and expectations assigned socially to individuals based on their perceived maleness, femaleness, masculinity, femininity, and/or stated identity. 

**Gender Identity**: An individual’s innate sense of being a man, a woman, and/or neither. This can differ from one’s gender assigned at birth, and through the process of social transition (which is often accompanied with medical transition), transgender people can make their gender align with their gender identity. 

**Woman**: An individual who is assigned feminine roles and expectations by society based on their perceived femininity, femaleness, and/or stated identity. 


## Acronyms

**GAHT** Gender Afirming Hormone Therapy

**HRT** Hormone Replacement Therapy

**SRS** (outdated) Sex Reasignment Surgery

## Biological Sex is Mostly Mutable

Many aspects of **biological sex can be changed** through medical transition, though it is not a requirnment to transgender identities.

For trans women on hormone replacement therapy (consisting of bioidentical estrogen and progesterone), they obtain female hormonal profiles, which alters the sexually dimorphic gene expression of their cells (everyone’s cells have the potential to express both male and female traits which are encoded in their DNA, and these traits are turned on and off by hormones). This causes their genes to express female traits, and they obtain real breasts that are anatomically identical to cis females (and capable of lactation (and there are even cis men who lactate, and the composition of their milk is in the normal range)), female skin texture, female body odor, female body fat distribution, female hair patterns in both body hair and head hair, female muscle mass, female bone density, and even female bone structure if they start early enough.

Bottom surgery reconstructs existing genitals into fully functional genitals of the opposite sex (functional genitals, not reproductive organs… although this is actively being researched!).

Medical transition can make trans people infertile, fertility banking should be encouraged for individuals seeking hormone therapy.

Hence, trans people can change their hormonal sex, the sex expression of their genes, their anatomical sex, and they can at least move over to the infertile category of reproductive sex. 


## Brain Sex

The human brain is an incredibly complex organ, with countless different structures specializing in different functions, but also adaptable (neuroplasticity).

### Brain Sex as a Mosaic

For decades we considered the brain to either be male or female (as strictly sexually dimorphic), however, recent research has revealed different frameworks for interpreting the sex of a brain. This has complex and nuanced implications for transgender individuals.

Daphne Joel and Cordelia Fine, experts on the subjects of neuroscience and philosophy of science respectively, argue that 17th and 18th century European society constructed the notoin that gender (& sex) are "meaningfully carved into two categories or “natural kinds,” that are distinct, timeless, and deeply biologically grounded," a conception that has persisted into recent history. This has also been perpetuated by the ableist research into autism and other neurodivergent conditions describing autism as an "extreme male brain" [(Joel & Cordelia, 2018)](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/03/opinion/male-female-brains-mosaic.html)

[2015 research fom Joel et al.](https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.1509654112) represents a picture of human brains as a "mosaics" constituting of more commonly male and more commonly female aspects. Brain sex cnannot be binarized, or even visualized as a continum, but as this mosaic.

### The Transgender Brain

Even with such a small window of sexually dimorphic brain variance, study after study after study indicates that trans people’s brain matter structures are more in-line with the sex/gender they transition to, even in many brain regions prior to medical transition. **NOTE: NOT FULLY CONCLUSIVE. LOOK INTO**

Unfortunately, many of these studies do not account for the total physical size of brains; however, the studies don’t account for this still indicate that trans people’s brain matter distributions are shifted towards the other/sex gender.

What sex characteristic should matter the most when we want to classify who someone truly is on the inside, and how we should treat them in social settings? It ought to be their brain sex, because who we are as a person inside is a result of our living, thinking, brain.

Additionally, the fact that there exists a wide variety of brain structures in-between what is typical of males and females gives rise to a potential biological explanation for non-binary identities and the various third-genders that have been recognized throughout human history.

Innate biological traits (e.g. genetic factors, prenatal hormone washes) play a role in shaping brain structure, as shown above. Sociological traits (e.g. culture, upbringing) also play a role in shaping brain structure.
Ultimately, brain structure is influenced by a complex combination of biological and sociological factors. The precise extent to which sexually dimorphic brain structures result from biological vs sociological factors is unknown, but this doesn’t change the fact that trans people’s brains are more like the sex and gender that they transition to.
But What About the Chromosomes?

X and Y chromosomal combinations are neither binary, nor a defining characteristic of one’s biological sex characteristics:

XX Males exist - De La Chapelle Syndrome
XY Females exist - Swyer Syndrome, Complete Androgen Insensitivity
X0, XXX, XXY, XYY, XXYY all exist as well!

0.5% of individuals have abnormal sex chromosomes, which accounts for millions of Americans alone and is about as common as being trans!
